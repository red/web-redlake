      Though we're still building our products we want to help - in the way we know best.
      So we have provided three auto-generated diagrams based on the [World Health Organization](http://who.int) information.

      Facts. Data. Diagrams. Stay informed. Though we're not ready for prime time we
      have decided to create and release a set of diagrams that depict the basic processes
      for controlling [covid-19](/covid-19/) .  
      
      Though we're still building our products we want to help - in the way we know best.
      So we have provided three auto-generated diagrams based on the [World Health Organization](http://who.int) information.
      - Basic health, [view](who-stay-safe.png) or [download](who-stay-safe.pdf)
      - How to wear masks, [view](who-masks-usage.png) or [download](who-masks-usage.pdf)
      - Staying home, remote work and learning, [view](healthy-isolated-and-remote.png) or [download](healthy-isolated-and-remote.pdf)

      We hope you find them useful. Print them, plaster them near places where people need to be reminded.
      Again: facts. Data. Stay informed. Stay healthy. Hang in there.
