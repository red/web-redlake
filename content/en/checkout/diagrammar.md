      So you can share your diagrams, watermark free. That's the only 
      limitation we have in place right now. We know people want to try
      tools first, and having features disabled sometimes doesn't give
      you the full picture. You can download the free version, but we're
      confident you'll be back once you see it in action. Buying it now
      just saves you some time.
      
      When you buy a DiaGrammar license, you get free updates until the next 
      major version, and then a nice discount when you upgrade. And your 
      support ensures that we can be there to support you, with new features, 
      assistance, and fixes for the long haul. There's nothing worse than 
      coming to depend on a tool and having it disappear or go stagnant.
      
      We're confident that nothing comes close to what DiaGrammar has to offer,
      and there's more to come. You want easy sharing and collaboration? A way
      to keep your grammars and diagrams safe and available on all your systems?
      Expanded command line automation for use with CI/CD? More metagrammars? All
      planned. And when you're part of the DiaGrammar community, we'll listen to
      what you want that we haven't thought of yet.
