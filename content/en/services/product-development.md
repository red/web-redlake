    content: "[The Red language](http://www.red-lang.org) is our secret weapon. Nobody understands it or wields it more effectively than we do; because we built it. It's fully open source, developed transparently, so you're never locked in or out. We can provide standalone EXEs with no dependencies, whether you're running on Windows, Linux, or pre-Catalina OS X. Anroid support is under development as well.
    
    If you're worried that your team can't learn a new language or set up a complex toolchain, don't worry. Red was designed to be familiar and accessible, while also showing that there's a better way to build software. The toolchain, just a single EXE that can cross-compile to any supported platform, and a self-hosted interactive console (a REPL to devs) for rapid work.

    content: "We like to be self-sufficient. That reduces risk. You probably agree. So our goal is to make sure the work we do can be carried forward by your team, if you so desire. Less code and fewer dependencies means fewer unknowns and less bugs. Our methodology? Keep things simple and communicate. If you use other technologies, we're probably familiar with them. We have over 100 years of combined software development experience on our team, from graybeards to young turks.
