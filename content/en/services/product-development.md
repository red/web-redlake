    content: "[The Red language](http://www.red-lang.org) is our secret weapon. Nobody understands it or wields it more effectively than we do; because we built it. It's fully open source, developed transparently, so you're never locked in or out. We can provide standalone EXEs with no dependencies, whether you're running on Windows, Linux, or pre-Catalina OS X. Anroid support is under development as well.
    
    If you're worried that your team can't learn a new language or set up a complex toolchain, don't worry. Red was designed to be familiar and accessible, while also showing that there's a better way to build software. The toolchain, just a single EXE that can cross-compile to any supported platform, and a self-hosted interactive console (a REPL to devs) for rapid work.
