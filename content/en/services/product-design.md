    content: "When designing a product, there are different stages and you need the right tool at each one. From sketches on napkins and workflow outlines, through data exploration and UX experiments, to full prototypes. Transitioning from the idea stage, with pencil in hand, to seeing something work on the computer needs to happen quickly, and allow play (both in terms of fun and flexibility). We specialize in [Red](http://www.red-lang.org), which is a great prototyping tool, and so much more. Often, prototypes end up transitioning to production.

    content: "[Red](http://www.red-lang.org) offers unmatched ease for expressing UIs quickly via its [VID](https://github.com/red/docs/blob/master/en/vid.adoc) domain specific language. But you can do more than UIs fast, you can build DSLs to match your problem domain in a few days (sometimes hours), parse and reformat data, access APIs, call system functions, and...come to think of it, there's nothing you *can't* do.
