    content: "Red's great power comes from the tons of features in a small executable **and** the ability to easily create DSLs using it's built-in `parse` function. So Red as a language morphs into your domain area, for example [ sell 10 shares AXG when price exceeds 42 dollars]. By allowing you to create DSLs and workflows quickly, Red helps getting better software as your product is expressed in your domain - you'll spot differences immediately.

    heading: "RED DSLs match your product development."
    content: "If you're a fan of Domain Driven Design (we are) you'll notice that the DSLs you create matchthe domain vocabulary. This creates no room for misiniterpretation and allows stakeholders and developers to speak the same language - the DSL.
    
    Technology is a means, not an end. Yes, we're technologists and deep thinkers,
      but we're also pragmatic and have broad experience across many industries. We don't
      throw technology at a problem and hope for the best. We work to understand the ultimate
      goal and match the solution to that need, keeping things as simple as possible.
