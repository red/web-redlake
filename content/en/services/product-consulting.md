    content: "Red's great power comes from its many diverse features, all packed in a small executable, and how it simplifies software development. Its crown jewel is the ability to easily create DSLs, so Red as a language morphs into your domain, not the other way around. For example, if you write a stock trading agent, it can easily understand [sell 10 shares AXG when price exceeds USD$42]. By leveraging the power of DSLs, both general and specific, Red makes it easier to express intent clearly, reduce code, and avoid errors.

    heading: "We know software. You know your domain."
    content: "If you're a fan of Domain Driven Design (as we are) you already know that good DSLs match the domain vocabulary. This leaves no room for misiniterpretation and allows stakeholders and developers to speak the same language. Solving problems with teams requires communication. We aim to make it as effective as possible.
    
    Technology is a means, not an end. Yes we're technologists and deep thinkers,
      but we're also pragmatic and have deep experience across many industries. We don't
      throw technology at a problem and hope for the best. We work to understand the ultimate
      goal and match the solution to that need, keeping things as simple as possible.
