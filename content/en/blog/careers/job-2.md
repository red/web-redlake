  If you know OS level coding, are familiar with multiple operating systems, and
  like the level of C, that's what we're talking about. You won't be using C,
  but a language that lives at the same level, while being more modern, and part
  of a full-stack (metal to meta) toolchain.

## About the Role

Redlake uses the Red and Red/System languages for most of our work. This position requires knowledge of C level coding, and experience working at that level on multiple operating systems. 

You'll work with a small team creating a self-hosted, cross-platform, cross-compiling toolchain. We don't emit C, or ASM, we emit machine code. LLVM and WASM are future targets. 

We have a partial GTK implementation, and core Android GUI, which need to come up to speed and match our Windows and MacOS GUIs. There are also low level algorithms to be ported to Red/System from C/C++, and new features to add on I/O, concurrency, and more. We specialize in our tools, but generalize in our tasks

### Requirements

* 1+ years experience or 4-year degree in Computer Science or related field
* Execution-focused. You love working on defined projects and you get stuff DONE.
* Ability to work across our stack (just Red!)
* Additional experience using Git, JavaScript, and SQL databases a plus
* Experience writing unit and integration tests
* Great communication skills
* Passion for creating simple, intuitive applications for customers worldwide
* Can-do attitude with a good sense of humor
