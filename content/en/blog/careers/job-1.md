description: >-
  If you know OS level coding, are familiar with multiple operating systems, and
  like the level of C, that's what we're talking about. You won't be using C,
  but a language that lives at the same level, while being more modern, and part
  of a full-stack (metal to meta) toolchain.

## About Us

See the main Careers entry to get a sense of who we are.

## About the Role

Redlake uses the Red and Red/System languages for most of our work. This position requires knowledge of C level coding, and experience working at that level on multiple operating systems. 

You'll work with a small team creating a self-hosted, cross-platform, cross-compiling toolchain. We don't emit C, or ASM, we emit machine code. LLVM and WASM are future targets. We are 32-bit only right now, but moving to 64-bits is a top priority.

On the GUI side, our main focus has been Windows and Mac, but we have a solid GTK implementation and core Android GUI. There are also low level algorithms to be ported to Red/System from C/C++, and new features to add on I/O, concurrency, and more. We specialize in our tools, but generalize in our tasks.

### Requirements

* 4+ years experience or 4-year degree in Computer Science or related field
* You can see the big picture, love R&D, but also focus on large coding tasks and details
* Ability to work across our stack (just Red!)
* Additional experience using Git, JavaScript, and other tools a plus
* Experience writing unit and integration tests
* Great communication skills
* Passion for fighting software complexity
* Can-do attitude with a good sense of humor
* Ability to work autonomously. Expect support, but not a babysitter.

## We Offer

Lean startup salary, coffee subsidy, the chance to change the world. Weâ€™re a tight-knit group and have a lot of fun!

## What's Next

Please submit your resume, cover letter, and any relevant links (e.g. Github/bitbucket/personal website). Please, no phone calls, drop-ins, or recruiters.
