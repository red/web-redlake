Just a short note to let you know we're still hard at work behind the
scenes. The rapid initial releases of DiaGrammar kept us busy, but 
there are more features in the works. Version 1.3 is expected to be
release in Q3, with a feature those of you working on large grammars
will appreciate. But the most effort has gone into the next stage
infrastructure for diagrams themselves. If you follow the Red 
language rooms on Gitter you may have seen mention of it. It's a
powerful and wide-ranging topic, which we expect DiaGrammar to 
leverage in new and exciting ways.

Keep the feedback and feature requests coming. Join us on 
[Gitter](https://gitter.im/redlake-comm/DiaGrammar)
and let us know what you're doing with DiaGrammar.

Happy diagramming!
