Fullstack Technologies is a great name. So great, in fact, that it's used by a number of companies around the world. During our planning and development process, we worked to keep the name for all our global ventures, but in the U.S. we hit a logistical issue that forced us to consider a name change. While Fullstack Technologies will live on, the new branding (company name) in the U.S. will be Redlake Technologies. 

Stay tuned for more news in the coming months. We're hard at work on the core technologies that will be the foundation of commercial products and services Redlake Technologies will offer.
