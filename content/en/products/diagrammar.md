  DiaGrammar is your new best friend, whether you write DSLs, document data formats, or publish APIs. Users want to understand your design quickly. Diagrams foster understanding, communication, and adoption. Today's stakeholders demand that designs are thought-out, documented, and tested. You need to look professional. More than that, you need to be professional. Don't hack, design. Don't hope, test. Don't guess, understand. Then show everyone what you've got.

      Facts. Data. Diagrams. Stay informed. While getting DiaGrammar ready for prime time we
      decided to create and release a set of diagrams that depict some basic processes
      for controlling [COVID-19](/covid-19/). View or download to spread the facts, not the
      virus.

      Whether you design languages and DSLs, parse or document data formats,
      or publish APIs, DiaGrammar is your new best friend. Users want to 
      understand your design quickly. Diagrams foster understanding, 
      communication, and adoption. Today's stakeholders demand that 
      designs are thought-out, documented, and tested. You need to look 
      professional. More than that, you need to be professional.
      
      Don't hack, design. Don't hope, test. Don't guess, understand. Then
      show everyone what you've got. Live coding is the best, most
      productive way to do this. You get immediate feedback, see and fix
      problems instantly, and work as fast as you can think.

      Do you design before you code? Do you wish you had time to document
      things professionally? Do you suffer the pain of keeping docs in
      sync with design changes? Us too.
      
      DiaGrammar generates syntax diagrams, live, as you write your
      grammar. There's no need to switch gears. Write your grammar and 
      your diagrams are already done, and always in sync.

Use the Generate feature to create randomly synthesized inputs that a rule, or your entire grammar, will recognize. If DiaGrammar generates it, it will also parse it. Generated inputs may show you things you didn't know your grammar could handle."

          DiaGrammar supports [Red](http://www.red-lang.org)'s `parse` dialect, ABNF, McKeeman,
          RegEx, YACC, and more. While Red's `parse` dialect is the most powerful, allowing 
          you to parse at the datatype level, and include actions directly, DiaGrammar lets you
          use what you already have. If you write RFCs for the W3C or IETF, you're going to use
          ABNF. If you teach college CS course, you may use YACC or Bison. Developers in many
          cases use regular expressions, which can be hard to understand once written. With
          DiaGrammar, you can compare two regex patterns to see if they generate the same 
          diagram, or how they differ.

        the inputs you've used with a grammar, so you can easily pick up where you left off."

        description: "Customize the rendered diagram, save and share it. There are a number of
        standard styles to choose from, but maybe you have a site your diagrams need to match,
        or a client's company colors. You may even want detailed control over the size and shape
        of elements in the diagram. DiaGrammar puts the power in your hands."

        description: "If you use [Red](http://www.red-lang.org)'s `parse` dialect, your grammar 
        interpreter is already done. You can add actions, set markers, extract content, and more.
        If you prefer ABNF or another grammar, you still have to write the code in another 
        programming language to process it. DiaGrammar can help. It can convert some metagrammars 
        to Red `parse` rules automatically."
