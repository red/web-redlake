Diagrams foster understanding, communication, and adoption. Today's stakeholders demand that designs are thought-out, documented, and tested. You need to look professional. More than that, you need to be professional. Don't hack, design. Don't hope, test. Don't guess, understand. Then show everyone what you've got. Live coding is the best, most productive way to do this. You get immediate feedback, see and fix problems instantly, and work as fast as you can think.

    heading: "Live Testing"
    content: "Write test inputs and run them against any rule in your grammar. Or put them in files and test against entire directories. Not only can you see if an input matches your entire grammar, you can select specific rules and find where they match parts of your input."

    content: "Not sure what valid inputs might look like, beyond those you come up with and design for? Use the Generate feature to create randomly synthesized inputs that a rule, or your entire grammar, will recognize. If DiaGrammar generates it, it will also parse it. Generated inputs may show you things you didn't know your grammar could handle."

        description: "If you use Red's Parse dialect, your grammar interpreter is already done. You can even add actions and more. If you prefer ABNF or another grammar, you'd still have to write the code in another programming language to process it. DiaGrammar can help. It can convert any metagrammar to Red Parse rules automatically."
