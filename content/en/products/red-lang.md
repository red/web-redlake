    content: "Red features super small executables - around 1 MB. Your scripts will be compiled with a small runtime for dynamic code. This can be on Windows, Linux, ARM, macOS. We hope to get the compiler producing executables so small that they will fit in some L2 caches. Oh, and Red produces machine code directly, no dependencies on compiler abstraction layers...
