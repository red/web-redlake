      [Red](https://www.red-lang.org/)’s ambitious goal is to build the world’s first full-stack language, a language you can use for C-level system programming, applications, high-level scripting, and metaprogramming. You've probably heard the term "full-stack developer". But what is a full-stack Language?
      
      Red is not your ancestor's "full stack" for the web. It's tomorrow's metal-to-meta one-stop-shop for developers. Polyglot programming is a thing of the past. Dialects are the future. Low level, high level, domain specific, what you need when you need it.

      It must be huge and complex then, right? Wrong. It's a single executable that takes in your source files on any platform, and produces a packaged binary for any platform, from any other. The tool doesn’t depend on anything besides what came with your OS...shipping as a single executable that’s just over a megabyte. A full cross-platform toolchain that's smaller than most web pages.
      
    right: |-
      But that technical feat alone isn't enough to define Red's notion of a "Full-Stack Language". It's about the ability to bend and redefine the system to meet any need, while writing maintainable code and getting top-flight performance.  It's more like a batteries-included language construction set than just a language.
      
      Whether you’re writing a device driver, a platform-native GUI application, or a shared library, Red lets you use a common syntax to code at the right level of abstraction for the task. It's the last language you'll ever need, because it can become the next language you need.
